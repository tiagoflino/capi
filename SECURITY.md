## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Capi, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, please use [GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/tiagoflino/capi/security/advisories/new) to report the issue to us privately. Alternatively, you can email us at tiagoflino@users.noreply.github.com.
